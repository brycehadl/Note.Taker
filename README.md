## Description

I was given the job of making Note Taker, a program that allows users to take and save notes, for this challenge.
The software saves and retrieves user-generated note data from a JSON file using an Express.js back end.

The front end of the application has already been developed. My responsibility is to construct the back end, link the two, and then publish the completed application to Heroku.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the file system module express version 4.18.2. Additionally, it uses a cloud platform called Heroku.

## Installation
. Clone the repo:
   git clone git@github.com:brycehadl/Note.Taker.git

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Proceed to install node.js v16 through the terminal. The command to run if you have homebrew should be something like this: brew install node@16. Nevertheless, this might not always work as expected, so you should check the instructions.


4. After installing node.js v16, initialize and create a package.json in the terminal by using the command npm init -y. This is where project files will be kept.
